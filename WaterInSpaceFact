Astronomers study objects found in space such as planets, moons, stars, solar systems and galaxies. 
Astronomy is one of the oldest fields of science.

There is floating water in space. 
Astronomers have found a massive water vapor cloud,
which holds 140 trillion times the mass of water in the Earth's oceans, somewhere around 10 billion light years away,
making it the largest discovery of water ever found.
