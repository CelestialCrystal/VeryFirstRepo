There are 8 planets in our solar system, they are:
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. 
With the exception of Neptune and Uranus,
the other 6 planets can be seen unaided
and all 8 are visible with a small telescope or binoculars.

There is floating water in space. 
Astronomers have found a massive water vapor cloud,
which holds 140 trillion times the mass of water in the Earth's oceans, somewhere around 10 billion light years away,
making it the largest discovery of water ever found.

Space is amazing and large!
